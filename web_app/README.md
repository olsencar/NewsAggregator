This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

### How To Run

1. Make sure that you have access to the DB credentials. This will be located in `web_app/config/config.json`.
2. In the terminal, navigate to the `web_app/client` directory and run `npm install`.
3. Navigate back to the `web_app` directory and run `npm install` again.
4. For development purposes, now run `npm run dev` to start the application.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Starts the server.

### `npm run server`

Starts the server using nodemon (preferred).

### `npm run client`

Starts the `react` client. This will trigger the React start script.

### `npm run dev`

For development, this starts the server and client concurrently.
