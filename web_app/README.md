This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Starts the server.

### `npm run server`

Starts the server using nodemon (preferred).

### `npm run client`

Starts the `react` client. This will trigger the React start script.

### `npm run dev`

For development, this starts the server and client concurrently.
